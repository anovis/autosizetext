# Autosize Text â€“ Figma plugin

This is the home for  ['Autosize Text' Figma Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin). The goal of this plugin is to automatically resize text to fit in its textbox.

## How this plugin works

When triggered this plugin autosizes text to fit within its textbox.

For example

### If text it too small it will grow to fit the bounds.

**Before:**

### If text it too big it will shrink to fit the bounds.


**Before:** 


![large before](images/big_before.png?raw=true)

**After:**
